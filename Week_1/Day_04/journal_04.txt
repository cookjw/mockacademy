Recursion Exercises
-------------------
First, we'll translate the exercises on recursion that Zack and his 
partner for the day, Ben Hass, did, in the file 
https://github.com/zackmdavis/App_Academy_Exercises/blob/master/Week_1/re
cursion.rb.
Note that since Zack and Ben modify Ruby's Array class in this file, 
this will give us the opportunity to practice the closest Python 
analogue of monkeypatching built-in types,
which is to create user-defined subclasses.

The first function in the file is called "range". Of course, Python has 
a built-in function called "range", so let's use a different name, 
"range1". (Experimentation with the interactive
interpreter shows that Python will let you overwrite its built-in range 
function if you want; this is no doubt related to the namespace 
hierarchy discussed in Chapter 9 of the Python tutorial.
Here, of course, we don't have any particular desire to usurp the name 
"range".) Note that in the original Ruby, the + operator is used to 
combine arrays. Does the same work for lists in 
Python? Yes, it turns out.


///Original(Ruby)///

def range(first, last)
  if (first == last)
    return [first]
  else
    return [first] + range(first + 1, last)
  end

end

///


///Translation(Python)///

def range1(first, last):
    if first == last:
        return [first]
    else:
        return [first] + range1(first + 1, last)
        
///

Experimentation shows that this behaves as expected.


The rest of the file consists mostly of methods that Zack and Ben add to 
Ruby's Array class. The first is recursive summation:

///Original (Ruby)///

class Array

  def sum_recursive
    if self.length == 0
      return 0
    elsif self.length == 1
      return self[0]
    else
      return self[0] + self[1...self.length].sum_recursive
    end
  end
  
 ///
 
 
 Note that a naïve "direct translation" won't work!:
 
 ///Translation Attempt (Python)///
 
 class Array(list):
    
    def sum_recursive(self):
        if len(self) == 0:
            return 0
        elif len(self) == 1:
            return self[0]
        else:
            return self[0] + self[1:len(self)].sum_recursive() 
 
 ///
 
 This works for an "Array" consisting of zero or one element, but as 
soon as we try it with two or more, we get "AttributeError: 'list' 
object has no attribute 'sum_recursive'."
 The problem is in the last line, where we write 
self[1:len(self)].sum_recursive(). Remember in Python we can't change 
the built-in list type; our "Array" is a new class, for all that it 
 inherits the methods of list. We need to write, instead:
 
 ///Transation (Python)///
 
 class Array(list):
    
    def sum_recursive(self):
        if len(self) == 0:
            return 0
        elif len(self) == 1:
            return self[0]
        else:
            L = Array()
            for n in range(1, len(self)):
                L.append(self[n])
            return self[0] + L.sum_recursive()

///

The next method is iterative summation (recall the distinction between 
recursion and iteration from SICP 1.2.1):

///...Original (Ruby) (cont.)///
  def sum_iterative
    sum = 0
    self.each do |n|
      sum += n
    end
    sum
  end

end

///

///...Translation (Python) (cont.)///

    def sum_iterative(self):
        sum = 0
        for n in self:
            sum += n
        return sum  
        
///

At this point in the original file, Zack and Ben temporarily exit the 
Array class definition and define a couple of new outside functions. In 
Python, you can't "temporarily" exit a class
definition, because when you "return" you will be creating a new class 
with the same name. (You can modify an existing user-defined class in 
Python, but it's more awkward:
you have to define new methods as functions outside the class, then 
write something like MyClass.newmethod = newmethod. I've also seen 
mention of something called "decorators", but I don't
know what that is yet.) So, we are faced with a choice here: either 
continue to actually translate the *code*, which will require reordering 
the elements and putting all the new Array 
methods under a single class definition, or merely "translate" the 
*exercise*, which won't (since the point is mostly about the method 
definitions themselves, without any specific larger
context). Since this is an exercise after all, we'll opt for the latter. 
(It's not like it would be difficult to change, anyway.) EDIT: Actually, 
I've changed my mind, and will go for the
accurate translation after all.

So, next we have "dumb" and "smart" exponentiation (so named because the 
first one requires a linear number of multiplications, the second log):

///Original (Ruby)///
def expt_dumb(base, exp)
  if exp == 0
    return 1
  else
    return base*expt_dumb(base, exp-1)
  end
end
///

///Translation (Python)///

def expt_dumb(base, exp):
    if exp == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return base*expt_dumb(base, exp - 1)

///


///Original (Ruby)///

def expt_smart(base, exp)
  # O(lg "exp") multiplications --- more efficient!
  if exp == 0
    return 1
  elsif exp % 2 == 0
    n = expt_smart(base, exp/2)
    return n * n
  else
    n = expt_smart(base, (exp-1)/2)
    return base * n * n
  end
end

///

///Translation (Python)///

def expt_smart(base, exp):
    # O(lg "exp") multiplications --- more efficient!
    if exp == 0:
        return 1
    elif exp % 2 == 0:
        n = expt_smart(base, exp/2)
        return n*n
    else:
        n = expt_smart(base, (exp-1)/2)
        return base*n*n        

///

Next we add another list method:

///Original (Ruby)///

class Array

  def deep_dup
    arr = []
    self.each do |el|
      if el.is_a?(Array)
        arr << el.deep_dup
      else
        arr << el
      end
    end
    arr
  end

end
///

This method, you may notice, does exactly nothing. Or, more precisely, 
it returns an identical copy of the array.

///Translation (Python)///
    
def deep_dup(self):
    arr = []
    for el in self:
        if type(el) == Array:
            arr.append(el.deep_dup())
        else:
            arr.append(el)            
    return arr
    
Array.deep_dup = deep_dup    
    
///

Testing confirms the "functionality" specified above. Note that Ruby 
object.is_a?(Class) corresponds to Python type(object) == Class.

Next we have iterative and recursive Fibonacci numbers:

///Original (Ruby)///

def fibs_recursive(n)
  if n == 0
    return []
  elsif n == 1
    return [0]
  elsif n == 2
    return [0, 1]
  else
    prev = fibs_recursive(n-1)
    return prev + [prev[-1]+prev[-2]]
  end
end

///

///Translation (Python)///

def fibs_recursive(n):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0,1]
    else:
        prev = fibs_recursive(n-1)
        return prev + [prev[-1]+prev[-2]]

///

///Original (Ruby)///

def fibs_iterative(n)
  if n == 0
    return []
  elsif n == 1
    return [0]
  else
    fibs = [0, 1]
    (n-2).times do
      fibs << fibs[-1] + fibs[-2]
    end
    return fibs
  end
end

///

///Translation (Python)///

def fibs_iterative(n):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    else:
        fibs = [0, 1]
        k = 1
        while k <= n-2:
            fibs.append(fibs[-1] + fibs[-2])
            k += 1
        return fibs

///

Next come two versions of binary search.

///Original (Ruby)///

def binary_search(array, first, last, target)
  middle = (last - first)/2 + first
  middle_val = array[middle]
  if middle_val == target
    return middle
  elsif middle_val < target
    return binary_search(array, middle + 1, array.length-1, target)
  else
    return binary_search(array, 0, middle, target)
  end
end

///

///Translation (Python)///

def binary_search(array, first, last, target):
    middle = (last - first)/2 + first
    middle_val = array[middle]
    if middle_val == target:
        return middle
    elif middle_val < target:
        return binary_search(array, middle + 1, len(array) - 1, target)
    else:
        return binary_search(array, 0, middle, target)
        
///

In both Python and Ruby, this produces recursion-depth errors when run 
on the interactive interpreter on arrays with as few as 100 elements. 
Let's see if the second is better:

///Original (Ruby)///

def binary_search2(array, target)
  middle = array.length/2
  middle_val = array[middle]
  if middle_val == target
    return middle
  elsif middle_val < target
    return middle + 1 + binary_search2(array[middle + 
1..array.length-1], target)
  else
    return binary_search2(array[0...middle], target)
  end
end

///

///Translation (Python)///

def binary_search2(array, target):
    middle = len(array)/2
    middle_val = array[middle]
    if middle_val == target:
        return middle
    elif middle_val < target:
        return middle + 1 + binary_search2(array[middle + 1 : 
len(array)], target)
    else:
        return binary_search2(array[:middle], target)

///

This one indeed seems to work without problems, but I don't know what 
the difference is, exactly -- specifically, I don't know why the second 
should be so much more efficient.
They both have the same number of recursions, don't they? The main 
difference seems to be that binary_search2 is applied to lists of 
progressively smaller size as the recursion progresses. 
Apparently, even though nothing is done with most of the elements of 
array in binary_search, merely continuing to formally pass the whole 
list to the function each time causes the problem.
Let's note this point for future reference.

Next we have an algorithm for making change, which Zack and Ben take 
care to note is not "optimal" (I'm not sure what "optimal" means in this 
context):

///Original (Ruby)///

def make_change(amount, denominations = [25, 10, 5, 1])
  # take the largest element of denominations less or equal to than 
amount
  # appended with recursive call to same
  # this "greedy" algorithm gives correct change, but not optimal 
change
  if amount == 0
    return []
  else
    next_coin = denominations.select{|n| n <= amount}[0]
    [next_coin] + make_change(amount-next_coin)
  end
end

///

///Translation (Python)///

def make_change(amount, denominations = [25, 10, 5, 1]):
    # take the largest element of denominations less or equal to than 
amount
    # appended with recursive call to same
    # this "greedy" algorithm gives correct change, but not optimal 
change
    if amount == 0:
        return []
    else:
        next_coin = [n for n in denominations if n <= amount][0]
        return [next_coin] + make_change(amount-next_coin)

///

Next, we add Mergesort to the Array methods; this involves some 
trickiness in the translation.


///Original (Ruby)///

class Array
  def self.my_merge(left, right)
    merged = []
    until left.empty? && right.empty?
      if left.empty? || right.empty?
        merged += left + right
        return merged
      elsif (left[0] < right[0])
        merged << left.shift
      else
        merged << right.shift
      end
    end
    merged
  end

  def my_mergesort
    if self.length <= 1
      return self
    else
      middle = self.length/2
      left = self[0...middle].my_mergesort
      right = self[middle...self.length].my_mergesort
      return Array.my_merge(left, right)
    end
  end

end

///

The first thing to notice is that the merge function is named 
"self.my_merge". We can't write that in Python (it will raise a 
SyntaxError); so what does it mean? It turns out to mean that
my_merge is supposed to be a *static method* -- which apparently means a 
method that doesn't take the object as an implicit argument. In other 
words, we really want my_merge(left, right), not 
my_merge(self, left, right). In Python, the way to accomplish this is 
(after defining my_merge) to write Array.my_merge = 
staticmethod(my_merge) (instead of Array.my_merge = my_merge).

Also note the Ruby syntax: && for "and", || for "or" -- apparently the 
difference is order of precedence (these get evaluated before the 
corresponding words) -- and the empty? method. 

///Translation (Python)///

def my_merge(left, right):
    merged = []
    while not (len(left) == 0 and len(right) == 0):
        if len(left) == 0 or len(right) == 0:
            merged += left + right
            return merged
        elif left[0] < right[0]:
            merged.append(left.pop(0))
        else:
            merged.append(right.pop(0))
    return merged

def my_mergesort(self):
    if len(self) <= 1:
        return self
    else:
        middle = len(self)/2
        selftomiddle = Array()
        for x in self[:middle]:
            selftomiddle.append(x)
        left = selftomiddle.my_mergesort()
        selfmiddleon = Array()
        for x in self[middle:]:
            selfmiddleon.append(x)
        right = selfmiddleon.my_mergesort()
        return Array.my_merge(left, right)    

 
Array.my_merge = staticmethod(my_merge)
Array.my_mergesort = my_mergesort  

///

Remember, unlike in the original Ruby, Array is a new class we've 
created which inherits list's methods, not a set of additional methods 
for list. This is why some circumlocution in the code 
is necessary in order to turn lists (such as self[:middle]) into 
Arrays.

The last function in the file is designed to compute the powerset of a 
set:

///Original (Ruby)///
 
def subsets(set)
  # P{S U {t}} = P{S} U {s U {t} | s >= P(S)}
  # id est, the powerset of the union of the set S and the singleton set 
{t} ...
  # equals the union of the powerset of S with
  # the sets s U {t} for all s in the the powerset of S
  if set.count == 0
    return [[]]
  else
    small = set.last
    return subsets(set[0...set.length-1]) +
     subsets(set[0...set.length-1]).map{|s| s + [small]}
  end
end  

///

Note: the fact described in the comment may be used to show (by 
induction) that the cardinality of the powerset of a set with N elements 
is 2^N.

For some reason, Zack and Ben defined their subsets function for arrays 
instead of sets (even though Ruby, like Python, has a set data type), so 
we'll do likewise in our Python version:

///Translation (Python)///

def subsets(set):
    # P{S U {t}} = P{S} U {s U {t} | s >= P(S)}
    # id est, the powerset of the union of the set S and the singleton 
set {t} ...
    # equals the union of the powerset of S with
    # the sets s U {t} for all s in the the powerset of S
    if len(set) == 0:
        return [[]]
    else:   
        small = set[-1]
        return (subsets(set[:len(set)-1]) + 
            [s + [small] for s in subsets(set[:len(set)-1])])  

///


Word Chains
-----------

Our task: "Find a way to mutate a dictionary word into another of the 
same length by changing one letter at a time,
with all the intermediaries also being valid words (e.g., *duck* to 
unprintable to *funk* to *fund*)." (Presumably,
"unprintable" means "fuck". It may be unprintable in a blog post, but we 
want our program to print it!)

We'll use the file dictionary.txt from Day 3. Let's see if we can 
practice getting Python to look in another directory. 
If this fails, we'll just save a copy in the Day 4 directory.

Attempt:

///Python///

f = open("..\Day 3\dictionary.txt")
wordlist = f.readlines()
f.close()

print wordlist[0]

///

It works! (This solution was arrived at by trial, error, and Google 
searching, of course.)

So now to our task.

First, let's test something: whether Python agrees with the 
(alphabetical) order the words in dictionary.txt are listed in:

///...Python...///

for i in range(len(wordlist)-1):
    if wordlist[i] > wordlist[i+1]:
        print "Violators!: {violator1} 
{violator2}".format(violator1=wordlist[i], violator2=wordlist[i+1])
print "Done"

///

Yikes! It turns out there are quite a lot of violators. This means, 
unfortunately, that we won't be able to apply what we've learned 
about efficient searching (binary search) in the easy way that I had 
hoped. (We could still do it, by coding-in the order convention
used in dictionary.txt, but I'm not sure I want to do that.)

(The output also reminds us that each word of the file comes with a 
newline character "\n" appended.)

Let's first write a function that changes a word by one (specified) 
letter:

///...Python...///

def mutate(word, letter_index):
    mutations = [word]
    for letter in string.ascii_lowercase:
        attempt = list(word)
        attempt[letter_index] = letter
        attempt = "".join(attempt) + '\n'
        if attempt in wordlist and attempt[:-1] != word:
            mutations.append(attempt[:-1])
    return mutations

///

This, of course, returns a list of all the words that differ from the 
given one by the specified letter. E.g., for ("duck",0) it returns
['duck', 'buck', 'fuck', 'luck', 'muck', 'puck', 'suck', 'tuck', 
'yuck']. (We'll call this a "mutate list".)

Now let's consider the problem. Suppose we want to get from "duck" to 
"fund". We should first note the letter(s) they have in common, because 

any searching through mutations of those letters will be a waste of time 
(EDIT: This is wrong!!). In this case, they share the second letter, 
index 1, "u". 

For each index where they don't have the same letter, we'll apply mutate 
and look in the resulting list to see whether there is a word whose 
letter at that index is the same as the target word. For example, from 
mutate("duck",0), we would select "fuck". If not, we proceed to the next 

index. If there are none in any of the mutation lists for any of the 
indices, our task is impossible and the program should end. However, if 
there 
is more than one such "eligible mutation", then we should keep track of 
all of them so that we can go back and try another if we run into a dead 
end
on one. 

Assuming we've got a shared-letter word for one of the indices, we can 
now consider this word to be our new origin word, and recurse:

///...Python...///

def wordchain(origin_word, target_word):
    if len(origin_word) != len(target_word):
        print "Sorry, words must be same length!"
    else:              
        wordlength = len(origin_word)    
        differlist = [i for i in range(wordlength) if origin_word[i] != 
target_word[i]]                        
        for i in differlist:
            for word in mutate(origin_word, i):
                if word == target_word:
                    print word                    
                elif word[i] == target_word[i]:
                    print word
                    wordchain(word, target_word)                    
///

This basically works, but the output isn't elegant. Here's what 
wordchain("duck", "fund") produces:

fuck
funk
fund
dunk
funk
fund


As you can see, it actually found *two* paths, but there's no labeling 
of this, and furthermore it doesn't
print the original word (origin_word). Also, of course, it prints 
stepping stones on the way to a dead end:
e.g., wordchain("bury, fund") yields:

fury


The problem of not printing the original word can be easily gotten 
around by code outside the function:

///Python///
print origin_word
print wordchain(origin_word, target_word)
///

(Note that using print wordchain(...) will produce "None" at the end of 
the output, since the function doesn't
return anything. For now I'm treating this as a useful signal that the 
output is finished, although...LAZY HACK!)
While we're at it, let's go ahead and add an interactive prompt:

///...Python...///

origin_word = raw_input("Enter starting word: \n")
target_word = raw_input("Enter target word: \n")

print " "

print origin_word
print wordchain(origin_word, target_word)

///

As for the other issues, we'll make a quick attempt. Let's put the code 
that performs each one-letter "step" inside
its own function:

///Python///

def wordstep(origin_word, target_word, list):            
    wordlength = len(origin_word)    
    differlist = [i for i in range(wordlength) if origin_word[i] != 
target_word[i]] 
    stepword = False         
    for i in differlist:            
        for word in mutate(origin_word, i):                              
     
            if word[i] == target_word[i]:
                stepword = True
                list.append(word)                
    return (stepword, list[-1]) 
    
def wordchain(origin_word, target_word):
    if len(origin_word) != len(target_word):
        print "Sorry, words must be same length!" 
    else:    
        chain = [origin_word]
        word = origin_word
        while (not target_word in chain) and wordstep(word, target_word, 
chain)[0] == True:
            print word        
            word = wordstep(word, target_word, chain)[1]
        if target_word in chain:        
            print target_word
        else:
            print "Failed!"

/// 

This seems to work, although the internal list called chain doesn't look 
like I expect it to.
No doubt this has to do with the fact that all of wordstep has to be 
performed in order to check
the while condition.

Rather than refining further, I'll move on to checking (and translating) 
what Zack and Ben did in Ruby.

WAIT NO! I just discovered that my program doesn't work after all. I had 
neglected to consider the possibility 
that a step in the chain need not change a letter to the corresponding 
letter in the target word. E.g.: 

bunt -> hunt -> hint -> tint

So I'll have to fix this, and it'll basicaly require rethinking the 
problem from (almost) scratch.

The mutate function, at least, should still be good for use. 

[A bunch of thinking and preliminary attempts without really getting off 
the ground...]

Actually, Zack mentions [breadth-first 
search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) in his [blog 
post](http://zackmdavis.net/blog/2013/09/app-academy-diary-week-one/); 
let's go ahead and (formally) learn this algorithm and see if we can 
apply it. We'll first have to understand the concept of a *queue*. 

A queue is a type of list with two operations: adding an element to the 
"rear" ("enqueuing") and taking an element out from 
the "front" ("dequeuing"). It is, thus, a "first-in-first-out" (FIFO) 
data structure. Python comes with a Queue
module, so we don't have to worry about implementing this ourselves (at 
least for our purposes here). 

Here is Wikipedia's description of the breadth-first search (BFS) 
algorithm:

1. Enqueue the root node
2. Dequeue a node and examine it
 - If the element sought is found in this node, quit the search and 
return a result.
 - Otherwise enqueue any successors (the direct child nodes) that have 
not yet been discovered.
3. If the queue is empty, every node on the graph has been examined – 
quit the search and return "not found".
4. If the queue is not empty, repeat from Step 2.

Then appears the comment:

Note: Using a stack instead of a queue would turn this algorithm into a 
depth-first search.

This comment may be key in terms of understanding what was at the root 
of my difficulties: the issue
seems to have been that I could not think of how to move horizontally in 
the search tree while still "remembering" 
to search child nodes later. This is exactly what a queue allows one to 
do. 

In the context of this problem, a node corresponds to a word, and the 
child nodes of a node correspond to the 
words in (all of) the mutate lists for that word (i.e. for each letter 
position). 

Translating the pseudocode given in Wikipedia into Python:

///Python///

import Queue

def wordfind(origin_word, target_word):
    if len(origin_word) != len(target_word):
        print "Sorry, words must be same length!" 
    
    else:
        Q = Queue.Queue()
        V = set()
        Q.put(origin_word)
        while not Q.empty():
            word = Q.get()
            if word == target_word:
                return word
            else:
                for letter_index in range(len(word)):
                    for wordie in mutate(word, letter_index):
                        if not wordie in V:
                            V.add(wordie)
                            Q.put(wordie)

/// 

 
Now, of course, this procedure only returns the target word; while it 
will (necessarily) "find" a word chain,
it won't tell us what it is. To get it to do that, we have to program it 
to "remember" ancestor nodes. So, instead of
just a set consisting of all the nodes we've examined, let's build a 
dictionary which will tell us the immediate ancestor
of each node as well: 

///Python///

import Queue        

def wordchain(origin_word, target_word):
    if len(origin_word) != len(target_word):
        print "Sorry, words must be same length!"     
    else:
        Q = Queue.Queue()        
        A = {} # for "Ancestor"
        Q.put(origin_word)        
        while not Q.empty():
            word = Q.get()            
            if word == target_word:                
                revchain = [target_word]
                w = target_word
                while w != origin_word:
                    revchain.append(A[w])
                    w = A[w]           
                chain = revchain[::-1]
                return chain                    
            else:
                for letter_index in range(len(word)):
                    for wordie in mutate(word, letter_index):
                        if not wordie in A:                            
                            A[wordie] = word
                            Q.put(wordie)

/// 
 
It works!!! 

For example, it finds the following 14-word chain from "great" to 
"blade":

["great", "treat", "tread", "bread", "break", "wreak", "wreck", "wrack", 
"track",
 "trace", "brace", "braze", "blaze", "blade"] 

*Now* let's see what Zack and Ben did in Ruby.



Translation of Davis & Hass Word Chains
----------------------------------------

Ach! So they used an object-oriented approach; should have known. 
(Recall that "object-oriented" is jargon
for "using classes".) It begins:

///Original (Ruby)///

class String
  def adjacent?(word)
    return false unless self.length == word.length
    matches = 0
    word.length.times do |i|
      matches += 1 if self[i] == word[i]
    end
    (word.length - matches) == 1 ? true : false
  end
end

///

This, nota bene, is once again a modification of a built-in Ruby class. 
As we know, we can't do that in Python;
we have to inherit from the corresponding class (str) instead:

///Translation (Python)///

class String(str):
    def adjacent(self, word):
        if not len(self) == len(word):
            return False
        matches = 0
        for i in range(len(word)):
            if self[i] == word[i]:
                matches += 1
        if len(word) - matches == 1:
            return True
        else:
            return False
///

But wait a minute: this is going to be awkward, if not impossible, to 
use. How are we even going to construct a 
member of this class? Strings in Python are not mutable; in particular, 
there's no append method. You can't, as far as I know,
take a string, like "mystring", and make it an instance of our new 
subclass String. So let's take a step back and
think about how the original code is going to be used. If we do that, we 
realize almost immediately that we just want
a way of determining whether the "adjacent" condition holds between two 
strings (which, by the way, is nothing more than
whether one is in a mutate list of the other, in the terminology of our 
own Word Chain program from before), and there's no reason
that this should be a one-argument method on a string, instead of a 
two-argument function of two strings. It seems, rather, to be
simply a question of idiomatic Ruby, where we have word.length instead 
of Python's len(word). So never mind the new subclass, let's
just make adjacent a new (outside) function:

///Translation (Python)///

def adjacent(word1, word2):
    if not len(word1) == len(word2):
        return False
    matches = 0
    for i in range(len(word2)):
        if word1[i] == word2[i]:
            matches += 1
    if len(word2) - matches == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False  
        
///     


The class WordChains then begins:

///Original (Ruby)///

class WordChains

  DICTIONARY = File.readlines('dictionary.txt').map(&:chomp)

  def adjacent_words(word)
    DICTIONARY.select { |other_word| other_word.adjacent?(word) }
  end
  
///   

Capital letters in Ruby indicate constants, which don't exist in Python 
(caveats needed here?). 
And if we simply do this:

///Translation Attempt (Python)///

class WordChains:
    
    dictionary = [word[:-1] for word in open("..\Day 
3\dictionary.txt").readlines()]
    
    def adjacent_words(self, word):
        return [other_word for other_word in dictionary if 
adjacent(other_word, word)]  
///

we'll get "NameError: global name 'dictionary' is not defined" when we 
try to call adjacent_words
on a WordChains instance. I'm not sure why this is (doesn't the above 
code tell Python to assign the
name "dictionary" as soon as an instance of WordChains is created?), but 
the following "normal" code
fixes it:

///Translation (Python)///

class WordChains:

    def __init__(self):    
        self.dictionary = [word[:-1] for word in open("..\Day 
3\dictionary.txt").readlines()]
    
    def adjacent_words(self, word):
        return [other_word for other_word in self.dictionary if 
adjacent(other_word, word)]        

///    

EDIT: Turns out the problem was in adjacent_words, where we needed to 
write self.dictionary; the following 
works:

///Translation (Python)///

class WordChains:
       
    dictionary = [word[:-1] for word in open("..\Day 
3\dictionary.txt").readlines()]
    
    def adjacent_words(self, word):
        return [other_word for other_word in self.dictionary if 
adjacent(other_word, word)]


///

Next is a method called find_chain:

///...Original (Ruby)...///

  def find_chain(start, target)
    found = false
    scanned = []
    to_scan = []
    to_scan.push({start => nil})
    while !to_scan.empty? and !found do
      scanning = to_scan.shift
      if scanning.keys[0] == target
        found = true
        scanned.push(scanning)
      else
        adjacent_words(scanning.keys[0]).each do |adj_word|
           if !scanned.include?(adj_word) and 
!to_scan.include?(adj_word)
             to_scan.push({adj_word => scanning.keys[0]})
           end
        end
        scanned.push(scanning)
      end
    end
    found ? construct_path(target, scanned) : nil
  end 

///

///...Translation (Python)...///

    def find_chain(self, start, target):
        found = False
        scanned = []
        to_scan = []
        to_scan.append({start : None})
        while (not to_scan == []) and (not found):
            scanning = to_scan.pop(0)            
            if scanning.keys()[0] == target:
                found = True                
                scanned.append(scanning)
            else:
                for adj_word in 
self.adjacent_words(scanning.keys()[0]):
                    if not adj_word in scanned and not adj_word in 
to_scan:
                        to_scan.append({adj_word : scanning.keys()[0]})
                scanned.append(scanning)
        if found:
            return self.__construct_path(target, scanned)

///


This is basically exactly equivalent to the breadth-first search we 
wrote before, but note the manual implementation of
queue behavior and the technique of building a list of one-entry 
dictionaries (in Ruby terminology, an array of one-entry hashes).
Also note that although __construct_path is defined "later" (see below), 
it is able to be called here. Finally, the word "return"
in the last line is very important!

The method construct_path is private in the original, so in our 
translation we'll give it the double-underscore prefix:      

///...Original (Ruby)...///

private

  def construct_path(target, scanned)
    chain = [target]
    backlink = scanned.find{|h| h.keys[0] == target}
    parent = backlink[target]
    until parent.nil?
      chain.push(parent)
      backlink = scanned.find{|h| h.keys[0] == parent}
      parent = backlink[parent]
    end
    chain.reverse
  end

///

///...Translation (Python)...///

    def __construct_path(self, target, scanned):
        chain = [target]
        backlink = [h for h in scanned if h.keys()[0] == target][0]
        parent = backlink[target]
        while not parent == None:
            chain.append(parent)
            backlink = [h for h in scanned if h.keys()[0] == parent][0]
            parent = backlink[parent]
        return chain[::-1]


///

Success!
